# Quickstart

This quickstart guide will show you how to implement Single Sign-on (SSO). Scalekit is an authentication middleware between your application and Identity Providers over the OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocols.

## Sequence of Authentication

Scalekit springs into action when the user logs into your app. It lets your app authenticate with the IdPs of choice and lets your customers configure by getting their own admin portal.

Visualize the authentication flow with this high-level diagram:

1. User triggers SSO by logging into your app
   1. When a user attempts to log in, your app recognizes the need for SSO.
2. Your app redirects to Scalekit with the user identifier
   1. Your app sends the user to Scalekit's Authorization URL.
   2. It includes a unique identifier like the user's email or organization ID.
   3. Your app also provides a Redirect URI for Scalekit to use later.
3. Scalekit identifies the user's SSO provider.
   1. Using the provided user details, Scalekit determines the correct SSO setup.
   2. It then redirects the user to their organization's identity provider (IdP).
4. IdP authenticates the user
   1. The user's IdP takes over, authenticating them via SAML or OIDC protocols.
   2. These are industry-standard protocols for secure, seamless authentication.
5. IdP sends user profile to Scalekit
   1. After successful authentication, the IdP shares user profile details with Scalekit.
6. Scalekit redirects user back to your app.
   1. Scalekit sends the user to the Redirect URI you provided earlier.
   2. It includes a one-time code in this redirection.
7. Your app exchanges code for user details.
   1. Your app sends the one-time code and your API credentials to Scalekit.
   2. In return, Scalekit provides the user details it received from the IdP.
8. Your app logs in the user.
   1. Using the user details from Scalekit, your app creates a session.
   2. The user is now logged in and can access your app's resources.

Scalekit puts all these exchange mechanisms behind these steps on autopilot. In this guide, we use Scalekit SDK to implement SSO. If you prefer to use API endpoints, refer to REST APIs.

## Environment Setup

Before diving in, make sure you have:

- Access to your Scalekit account and API credentials
- Your app's codebase for implementing and testing changes

### Install the Scalekit SDK

Scalekit offers language-specific SDKs for fast SSO integration.

Here's how to install for Node.js:

<InstallSDK />

The installation steps for Python is coming soon.

### Set up API credentials

Secure your Scalekit API communication by setting up environment variables. You'll need three key pieces of information from your Scalekit Dashboard:

1. **Environment URL**: The base URL for API calls. Each environment (dev, staging, prod) has a unique URL.
2. **Client ID**: Your app's unique identifier for Scalekit communications.
3. **Client Secret**: A private key to authenticate your API requests. Always keep this secret!

#### Get Your Credentials

1. Log into your Scalekit Dashboard.
2. Select the "Development" environment.
3. Click on "API Config" to view your credentials.

#### Store Credentials Securely

Never hardcode secrets in your app. Use environment variables instead. Here's how to set them in a `.env` file:

```sh
SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL="https://yoursaas-dev.scalekit.com"
SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID="<COPY_CLIENT_ID_SCALEKIT_DASHBOARD>"
SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET="<COPY_SECRET_SCALEKIT_DASHBOARD>"
```

⚠️ Security Alert:

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control.
- Rotate your `secret `regularly. See our best practices guide for managing secrets.

Now you're ready to start integrating SSO into your app! Next, we'll cover how to use the SDK to authenticate users.

If you do not have an app ready to implement, see this tutorial on [how to implement SSO it from scratch](https://www.example.com).

## Authorize the Users

To start Single Sign-On (SSO), your app must redirect users to the Scalekit Authorization URL.

Construct the Authorization URL using the following query parameters:

**Redirect URI**: Where Scalekit sends users after IdP authentication.

Example: `https://your-saas-app.com/auth/callback`

After auth, Scalekit adds a temporary `code` to this URI. You'll `POST` this `code` with your `client_secret` to get user details.

**SSO Connection Identifier**: Tells Scalekit which IdP to use.

Provide one of:

- <SimpleCode>organization_id</SimpleCode>: Preferred for both SAML and OIDC.
  - Example: `org_12434341`
- <SimpleCode>connection_id</SimpleCode>: Specific SSO connection ID.
  - Example: `conn_121414141`
- <SimpleCode>domain</SimpleCode>: Organization mandate for domain-wide SSO. This query parameter automatically detects the appropriate SSO connection.
  - Example: `google.com` or `yourcustomerdomain.com`

**client_id**: Your app's unique Scalekit identifier which is mandatory for all requests. This Identifies both your app and the environment (staging, prod).

<p style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Example Authorization URL</p>

```jsx title="Authorization URL"
https://auth.scalekit.com/authorize?
  client_id=skc_122056050118122349527&
  redirect_uri=https://yourapp.com/auth/callback&
  organization_id=org_12434341
```

This URL tells Scalekit:

- Your app ID (`client_id`)
- Where to send the user after auth (`redirect_uri`)
- Which organization's IdP to use (`organization_id`)

See our [Authorization URL Parameters Guide](https://example.com) for a full list of accepted parameters.

Next, Construct your Authorization URL with these parameters and redirect users to this URL when they try to log in.

With Scalekit NodeSDK:

<Tabs groupId="tech-stack" querystring>
<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

````javascript showLineNumbers
import { Scalekit } from "@scalekit-sdk/node"

// initialize the SDK client
const scalekit = new Scalekit(
  SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL,
  SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID,
  SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET
);

// Option 1: Authorization URL with the organization ID
const authorizationURL = scalekit.getAuthorizationUrl(redirectUri, {
  organizationId: 'org_12442',
  state: state, // optional
});

// Option 2: Authorization URL with login hint
const authorizationURL = scalekit.getAuthorizationUrl(redirectUri, {
  loginHint: 'user@example.com', // optional
  organizationId: 'org_12442',
});

// Authorization URL with the connection ID
const authorizationURL = scalekit.getAuthorizationUrl(redirectUri, {
  connectionId: 'conn_1242242',
});

// TODO: redirect the user to this authorizationURL
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python showLineNumbers
from scalekit import ScalekitClient, AuthorizationUrlOptions, CodeAuthenticationOptions

scalekit_client = ScalekitClient(
  <SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL>,
  <SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID>,
  <SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET>
)

options = AuthorizationUrlOptions()
# use one of the three strategies below to determine how to log the user in.

# If you would like to authenticate the user via connection_id
options.connection_id = 'conn_1242242'

# If you would like to authenticate the user via organization_id
options.organization_id = 'org_12442'

# If you would like to authenticate the user via their email address
# Domain portion of the user's email address is used to detect the appropriate enterprise SSO connection
options.login_hint = '<user@example.com>'

authorization_url = scalekit_client.get_authorization_url(
  redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>,
  options=options
)
````

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Finally, handle the callback at your `redirect_uri` to complete the Authentication.

## Fetch User Details

After a successful SSO, Scalekit redirects the user to your `redirect_uri` with a unique `code` in the browser. Exchange the `code` for user profile details (on the serverside).

Here's how to turn that `code` into user data:

<Tabs groupId="tech-stack">
<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript showLineNumbers
const {
  code,
  error,
  error_description,
  idp_initiated_login,
  connection_id,
  relay_state,
} = req.query;

if (error) {
  // handle errors
}

// If it is an idp initiated login
if (idp_initiated_login && idp_initiated_login === "success") {
  const authorizationURL = scalekit.getAuthorizationUrl(redirectUri, {
    connectionId: connection_id,
    ...(relay_state && { state: relay_state }), // optional: pass relay state as state parameter
  });

  // Next:redirect the user to this authorizationURL
}

const res = await scalekit.authenticateWithCode({
  code: code,
  redirectUri: redirectUri,
});

// res.user has the authenticated user's details
const userEmail = res.user.email;

// Next step: create a session for this user and allow access
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

We mitigate [risks](https://example.com) for the users by performing Service Provider (SP) initiated authorization when users accesses [from the IdP](https://example.com) instead of your app.
