# Custom Domain and Theme

<Subtitle>Make Scalekit your own</Subtitle>

Scalekit's default behavior uses the auto-provisioned domain and branding in your application. However, it can be customized to represent your domain and brand, as described in the rest of this page.

## Custom Domain

Scalekit sets up your environment using a unique endpoint URL that ends with the scalekit.com domain. We offer an option to customize this domain using CNAME configuration.

| Before                                                            | After                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <SimpleCode> https:<nolink />//b2b-app.scalekit.com </SimpleCode> | <SimpleCode> https://<nolink />sso.b2b-app.com </SimpleCode> |

The URL is visible in the following ways:

- Organization users will see this URL in their browser’s address when they visit the [Admin Portal](https://example.org) to configure authentication settings.
- Organization users logging into the app using [SSO via SAML](https://example.org) (or) [SSO via OIDC](https://example.org) will see this URL in the browser's address bar as part of redirections to their Identity Providers.

1. CNAME Configuration Limitation: CNAME configuration is exclusively available for production environments.
2. SSL Certificate Automation: Upon successful CNAME record configuration in your domain registrar, the SSL certificate for the custom domain will be automatically set up.
3. Base URL: After successfully configuring CNAME for the production environment, ensure that the new CNAME URL is utilized as the base URL.

## Custom Theme

You can let your Organization's users (usually IT Administrators) configure SSO settings through a self-service Admin Portal. You can customize this portal to present your app’s brand.

- Show your brand’s logo on the Admin Portal.
- Match the Admin Portal with your brand’s color themes by updating its Accent Color.
- The Favicon on the browser tab can be updated to fit your brand.
